There are three pipelines to implement in the `stateful/` and `stateless/` folders - two stateless and one stateful.
Implementing the pipelines will require filling out the definitions of operators
like `Map` and `Filter`, which can be found in the `operators` folder.

These examples use java 17 with maven for builds/dependency management.
